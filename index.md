## Quarter 2 Project Proposal Brainstorming

**What is the most interesting topic covered in your domain this quarter?**

Exploring the integration of large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT with geo-mapping and real-time local store data to optimize shopping experiences.  

**Describe a potential investigation you would like to pursue for your Quarter 2 Project.**
Developing an LLM-powered application that enables users to:  
1. Query local stores for product availability.  
2. Compare prices across nearby locations.  
3. Use geo-mapping to recommend the most favorable store options based on price and proximity.  

This project could also investigate user behavior patterns to refine recommendations and enhance efficiency in real-time.  

**What is a potential change you’d make to the approach taken in your current Quarter 1 Project?**
Incorporate more advanced techniques to improve data aggregation from local stores, including APIs or web scraping, and refine the model’s ability to process unstructured data (e.g., user-generated shopping lists). Additionally, using feedback loops to continually enhance recommendation accuracy.  

**What other techniques would you be interested in using in your project?**
- Natural Language Processing (NLP) for understanding nuanced shopping queries.  
- Geo-location APIs for mapping and distance calculations.  
- Machine Learning algorithms to analyze pricing trends and predict favorable purchase opportunities.  
- A/B testing to optimize user experience and interface for the application.
